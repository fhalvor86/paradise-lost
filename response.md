> What is your response to Milton's observation?

While everyone may differ in their interpretation, Milton's morality is oversimplififed
either good or evil. In reality, there are more forces than just good and evil. However the dichotomy of these two forces, though oversimplified, create a tension between a trust and distrust of God; humans are left unsure of what is in their human nature and what has been forced upon them by something greater than them.
