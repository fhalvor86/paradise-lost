> What is your response to Milton's observation?

> The work allows humans to shrug off responsibility and gives more power to the supernatural. These dueling arguments create a tension between a trust and distrust of God; humans are left unsure of what is in their human nature and what has been forced upon them by something greater than them. For the time, this was a radical idea: that God and the supernatural may not have authority or may have ALL authorityâ€”even over evil.
