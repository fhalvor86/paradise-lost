> Milton intends to use *Paradise Lost* "justifie the wayes of God to men." Milton seeks to address the claim that God is either not omnipotent or not benevolent by discussing the nature of evil, and the way it could exist within a framework where God is both omnipotent and all benevolent. Specifically, the claim that God would allow evil to exist, by leaving Satan with his power. Milton argues that this is because, without evil, good cannot exist--good is relative.
